## ðŸ§ª Multimedia Showcase Page

### ðŸ”§ Instructions

> [!TIP]
> Always aim to keep your site visually clear and well-structured. Proper spacing, alignment, and consistent styles help make your content more readable and professional.

1. Inside your course repository, **create a new folder named `task-c`**.

2. In that folder, create a file named `index.html` and another named `style.css`.

3. In your `index.html`, add the following content:

   * A `<h1>` heading titled "My Multimedia Showcase"
   * A **Creative Commons licensed image** embedded using `<img>` with `alt` text
   * An embedded **audio clip** (e.g., MP3 or OGG) using `<audio controls>`
   * An embedded **video clip** (e.g., MP4 or web video) using `<video controls>`
   * A paragraph explaining where the media was sourced and its license

4. Style the content with your `style.css` file:

   * Limit the image width to `100%` with `max-width: 500px`
   * Center the media elements on the page
   * Add spacing between sections

5. **Link the CSS file** in the HTML `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

6. Add **a personalized comment** at the top of both files:

   `index.html`:

   ```html
   <!--
   Author: Ville Heikkiniemi (CHANGE THIS)
   Date: 2025-09-01 (CHANGE THIS)
   -->
   ```

   `style.css`:

   ```css
   /*
   Author: Ville Heikkiniemi (CHANGE THIS)
   Date: 2025-09-01 (CHANGE THIS)
   */
   ```

7. **Push your code to GitHub**, making sure all files are inside `task-c`.

8. **Ensure the `task-c` folder is correctly included in your existing Azure Static Web App**. Your Static Web App should serve all weekly tasks from a shared root folder. Do not delete previous tasksâ€”each task should be placed in its own subfolder (e.g., `task-a`, `task-b`, `task-c`, etc.), and all should be accessible from the same deployed application.

9. **Validate your HTML code** using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Fix any major issues and ensure your code follows good structure.

10. **Submit the public URL** to the corresponding Task C assignment in **itslearning**.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The deadline is specified in itslearning and the submission will close automatically when the deadline is reached. No late submissions will be accepted.
